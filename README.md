My first repository
This is me, just learning about GitHub and how it can be used.

I'm currently studying for a B.Sc in Computer Science, with courses this year including:

M250 - Introduction to object oriented programming (Basically Java); and
M269 - Algorithms, Data Structures and Computability (Taught using Python)
